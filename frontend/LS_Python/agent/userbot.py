"""
Userbot manager: handles Telegram login (producing a session string) and joining
live streams (group video chats) in listen-only mode.

Uses:
  * pyrofork  -> imported as `pyrogram` (the maintained fork that works with pytgcalls)
  * py-tgcalls -> joins the group call / live stream

Login is two-phase because the login code arrives on the phone:
  * begin_login()   -> sends the code, returns a phone_code_hash
  * complete_login()-> submits code (+ 2FA password), returns the session string

Once an account is logged in, we keep its Client + PyTgCalls alive in a pool so
it can join multiple live streams without re-logging-in.

# When a group-call media socket dies, NTgCalls / py-tgcalls / pyrogram log
# "socket.send() raised exception" (and similar) on EVERY retry — dozens per
# second per bad transport. At the default log level that flood does real harm:
# it saturates the shard's single event loop doing I/O for the log lines, which
# in turn delays the WebRTC keepalives of the still-healthy bots on that shard
# and gets THEM evicted too (the whole-stream cascade). Pinning these noisy
# third-party loggers to ERROR keeps a single wedged transport from taking the
# rest of the stream down with it. Our own diagnostics use print(), so nothing
# useful is lost.

# Resilient 2FA / SRP helpers — fix for the tg-lion provisioning crash
# "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'p'".
#
# tg-lion's getCode toggles an account's cloud (2FA) password. For a short window
# right after that, Telegram can answer account.GetPassword() with an EMPTY SRP
# algorithm block; pyrofork then reads `algo.p` on that None and raises
# "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'p'". It is TRANSIENT — re-fetching a moment
# later returns a proper algo. Previously that one hiccup escaped provision_userbot
# unguarded, failed the whole login, and left the account needing a manual
# re-login. These helpers retry the glitch (and try every password we know) so a
# healthy account logs in on its own.

      * It fired `EditGroupCallParticipant` for ALL bots at the exact same instant

    THE FIX (mirrors the throttled, flood-aware join path):
      * A bounded semaphore + jittered stagger so edits trickle in instead of
        stampeding — this is what actually makes raise/lower land for everyone.
      * Real FLOOD_WAIT handling: short waits are slept-through and retried,
        long ones are skipped for that one bot (never crashes the batch).

    Telegram rate-limits VERY aggressively (a handful of calls can earn a
    multi-thousand-second FloodWait). Every failed "already taken" attempt still
    counts against that limit. `account.checkUsername` is a cheap read that is
    barely limited, so we probe with it and only spend ONE real updateUsername on
    a handle we already know is free. This is the difference between name/photo
    edits (generous limits) succeeding while username edits flood.

    Returns True if available, False if taken/invalid. FloodWaits are propagated
    to the caller (via _flood_retry) so the job can be rescheduled durably.
