"""
Database helper for the Iamhear userbot agent.

The agent talks to the SAME Neon Postgres database the website uses. There is no
HTTP API between them - the website writes "jobs" into the `jobs` table, and this
agent polls that table, executes each job (my.telegram.org app creation, userbot
login, live stream join, ...) and writes the result back.

This file uses psycopg (v3) with a simple connection-per-call model. That keeps
the agent dead-simple and robust whether you run it on a local PC or a VPS.

# WebRTC keepalives no longer fight over a single event loop.
#
# FAN-OUT jobs (view_post / react_post / leave_livestream_all) must act on EVERY
# bot, not just one shard's. They are enqueued (by the website AND the worker)
# as a single plain row with NO shard_index. Shard 0 then "expands" each into one
# copy PER shard (tagging payload.shard_index), and each shard runs its copy
# against its own local bots. The originating code needs to know nothing about
# shards, so the website stays completely shard-agnostic.
# check_frozen is fanned out too: a global health scan must reach EVERY shard's
# bots, not just the one shard that happens to claim the job (which would only
# probe ~1/N of the fleet and report the rest as untouched).

# calls run on the agent's single asyncio event loop, so when ~100 livestream
# joins finished at once and each wrote its result, the loop froze for many
# seconds doing back-to-back handshakes. While the loop is frozen, pytgcalls /
# pyrogram can't service their sockets -> "socket.send() raised exception", the
# agent appears stuck, and live-stream calls get dropped. A warm pooled
# connection turns each call into ~1-5 ms, so the loop stays responsive.
