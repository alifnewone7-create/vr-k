Iamhear userbot agent - main worker loop.

Run this on your local PC or a VPS. It connects to the SAME Neon database the
website uses, polls the `jobs` table, and executes each job:

  create_app          -> log into my.telegram.org, create the app, store api_id/hash
  submit_mtproto_code -> finish my.telegram.org login with the code you typed
  send_login_code     -> send a userbot login code to the phone
  submit_login_code   -> finish userbot login (+2FA), store the session string
  join_livestream     -> join a chat's live stream (listen-only)
  leave_livestream    -> leave the live stream
  leave_livestream_all-> drop a whole batch of userbots out of a stream at once
  view_post           -> view a channel post from every logged-in userbot
  detect_poll         -> read the most recent poll in a channel
  cast_vote           -> make one userbot vote on a poll option
  retract_vote        -> make one userbot remove its vote from a poll
  react_post          -> react to a channel post from all userbots, time-spread
  update_profile      -> change an account's name / username / profile photo
  delete_profile_photos -> remove an account's current + all past profile photos

Start it with:  python -m agent.worker      (from the LS_Python folder)
